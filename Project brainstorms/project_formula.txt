Formula for text-as-data research 


What question do you want to answer? This should be something you *actually* want to know, and it should end in a question mark.
I want to do some interesting question but I haven't decided yet. I can use the one I used for PLSC309 for now: In China, did the pork shares in meats’ consumption influences the beef demand?


What source of text data will you use?

What are two possible answers to the question?
In China, the pork shares in meats’ consumption influences the beef demand. 
In China, the pork shares in meats’ consumption doesn't influences the beef demand. 

How will the results of the quantitative text analysis demonstrate which of those answers is correct?
