##don't worry about that code






#########Practice questions:


####I'd like you to have experience creating documents from scratch



# 1. We originally set the proportion of the training set to be .8 --- what happens to performance when we set it at .2? Re-run all the code 
##after that point (with smoothing)

#The set you train now is about 20% of the original and the set you test is now 80% of the original. The accuracy has dropped from 0.94 to 0.79, precesion 
#has also dropped from 0.96 to 0.90. The higher the Prop_train set to be, the higher the accuracy is.


# 2. Read the help file about textmodel_nb . What does the "prior" argument do in Naive Bayes? What is the default value for this 
# argument in quanteda?
?textmodel_nb
#The "prior" argument in Naive Bayes Prior distributions refer to the prior probabilities assigned to the training classes, 
#and the choice of prior distribution affects the calculation of the fitted probabilities.
#The default is "uniform" priors, which sets the unconditional probability of observing the one class to be the same as observing any other class.


#3. Re-run the code with prior = "docfreq". Think about the proportions of classes in the dataset. How should this affect your outcome?
# Looking at the results of the code, were you right?
#"Document frequency" means that the class priors will be taken from the relative proportions of the class documents used in the training set. 
# This might make the outcome more accuracy as it is using the relative proportions that uesd in the training set, although it might be only a little difference.
#Looking at the results, the "docfreq" got accuracy of 0.9256, 0.7917 which is a little higher than the 0.9227, 0.7822 of the "uniform"
